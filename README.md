# Assembler and DisAssembler Implemented in Python and Assembly Languages
Assembly Language Assembler and Disassembler
This project provides a set of tools for assembly language enthusiasts, featuring both an assembler and a disassembler. The tools are implemented in both Python and Assembly (NASM). The assembler takes human-readable assembly instructions as input and generates machine code, while the disassembler performs the reverse operation, translating machine code back into assembly instructions.

Features
Assembler: Converts assembly instructions into machine code.
Disassembler: Converts machine code into human-readable assembly instructions.
Supports x86 architecture.
Implemented in Python and Assembly (NASM).
How to Use
Assembler
Open the terminal.
Navigate to the python_assembler or assembly_assembler directory, depending on whether you want to use the Python or Assembly version of the assembler.
Run the assembler script, providing the assembly instruction as input.
